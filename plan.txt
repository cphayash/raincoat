Planning raincoat

What I want to do is make decisions based on the weather.

Seems simple eough.  The complication comes from more complex weather.

For example, if it's raining, you'd want:
    - pants (preferably waterproof)
    - a raincoat
    - a shirt (doesn't really matter what type if you've got a raincoat)

However, if it's hot and rainy, like it can be in Hawaii, you'd want:
    - shorts
    - a raincoat (ideally a light one)
    - a shirt (probably short sleeves)


Also, remember to build in iterations.  Don't solve the whole problem at once.

BUT, design in such a way that you can easily update/upgrade
